# Sales_Data_Analysis
Performing Data Analysis using the Python Pandas Library on the Sales data generated by an electronics e-commerce website.


The sales data has been uploaded into the git repository. The data contains details like Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Price Each, Order Date and Purchase Address. The 
sales data contains data for all 12 months for the year. We first clean the data and perform data analysis to find out -
- In which month the maximum sale is made. 
- Which city makes the most purchases. 
- Analyse the customer behaviour by determining the time at which maximum purchases are made. 
- Try to figure out which products the customers buy in tandeem to provide them with any possible deals on the two iteams they have purchased.

We plot graphs to get a better understanding of the results we obtain.
